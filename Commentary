Expose to MVTest

>>If cookie exists with MVTest=567|Variant=9876
GET /MVTest/567/Variant/9876
200 Ok

POST /MVTest/567/Exposures ?? Variants may be better name?
{

	"AccountId":"qwerty",
	"Visit":"abcd"
}
>> Is this an Event or a Command?? If an event the event-stream could be named TestId-VisitorId - something listening to the projection of these stream types could issue commands to do things...
>> Hash (MD5) VisitorId, MVTestId to determine variant -- Need to cache the variant somewhere?? Cookie??

Success Criteria Met

{
	"VisitorId":"1234",

}
>> no need to pass variant or test as this can be determined based on exposures for visit - do we need visitor ID? maybe for correlation...


===== July 2013 ====

Thoughts: 

Should MV Test need to know about visit or visitor ???? or should it just get something to hash against? and pass it back as a correlation id? - We could use a sliding window for session identification?
Should we POST and Exposure which returns a list of options (rel) to PUT successes to? or is the successful outcome a different concept/resource?
Should we PUT to the SuccessCriteria resource as it will be well defined ahead of test ie PPS or Clicked on button x...?
Work out which Machine Learning algos to use in analysis of MVT and Personalisation use cases


Usage Scenarios:

MV Test, exposed and success criteria met in one session
MV Test, exposed in one session, come back, exposed again and this time success criteria met
MV Test, exposed and never triggered success criteria

n=1 Personalisation, exposed and success criteria met in one session
n=1 Personalisation, exposed in one session, come back, exposed again and this time success criteria met
n=1 Personalisation, exposed and never triggered success criteria

Success Criteria may be in another app? email for example? or twitter interaction?


Business Model:

Maas = MVT as a Service = MVT, Personalisation & Reporting/Feedback/API
Charge for MaaS by volume
Charge for personalisation dimensions/traits - eg 1, 5, 10, 25, 100, >100

Open Source the MVT & Personalisation service for community adoption

Closed source for the decision algorithms, reporting/analysis IPR

Lean start up

Financials: 

How much does it cost to -
	serve x MVTs? (bandwidth, compute, exposure & success criteria)
	serve y n=1?
	serve none? - overheads
	store each MVT
	store each personalisation trait
	service a customer
	advertise/business growth

TODO:- Business model canvas



Architecture:

Event Driven System with Immutable Event Store for analytics.
Realtime stream of events for correlation

Start on PaaS until volume dictats move but could end up with seperate systems - 

Run on AWS or similar.

core domain
	collection - node.js? .Net MVC?
	MVT - MD5 Hash, across integer space = variant by weighting
	persistence - EventStore as Book of Record
	personalisation & analysis - clojure? Julia? Graph DB? 
	account (setup, monitor/watch, finance, usage, reporting) - WebSockets browser based UI (gracefull fallback), d3

secondary domain
	public api(rate monitoring) = homegrown
	deployment = chef + orchestration (IronFan?)
	immune system(logging, testing, scaling, monitoring, alerting) = mix of Splunk?, Selenium, Phantomjs, NewRelic? AppDynamics?
	issue tracking = GitHub?
